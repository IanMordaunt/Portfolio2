## Portfolio: 

## Task: 
  Created a professional portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS.

Work Included:

  1.) Building a header that incorporated Name, Avator or Photo, and Links to selections about the person, their work, and contact information.

  2.) Having the links in the Nav bar implement the UI scroll to corresponding sections of the page.

  3.) Develope a flex-box layout of developers projects.

  4.) Allow for clicking on the application image which will take you to the deployed application. 

  5.) Use media query to present a responsive layout that adapts to the viewpoint. 

Results:

This project was very infomative in regards to the basic frame work of a html lay out and cascading styling sheet.

Being about to use diverse tags and apply classes to support attributes provided an encompassing lesson on how HTMl pairs so well with CSS. 

This project provides the perfect look inside the infinite world of front end website development.
